# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Either "Gomoku" or "Mario"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A two player game of Gomoku or a mario game. Using pygame to make gomoku.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will allow two players to play a game of gomoku where the players need to connet 5 of the white or black "dots". It wouldn't have much features since it is just a board game with a simple objective. One player will go first as the black side and the second player will play as the white one and they will go back and forth to try to connect 5 dots in a row.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable. N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable. N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The good outcome would be that the game has a board of 15 by 15 box and a player can place a dot. Not really sure what I can accomplush no matter what because I have no idea what to do currently and what am I able to do.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be that the borad can have 2 players playing and able to win by connecting 5 dots. I think I might be able to complete this but not really sure.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be that it could have 1 player playing and a computer that's able to play against the player. I would hope to have a computer able to follow the rules and try to connect the 5 dots while also trying to block the other player from connecting the 5 dots.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step would be to make the board. The second step would be to make the dots being able to be put down on the board. The third step would be have a player place down the dots on the board in the location they want. The fourth step would be to make two players able to place down the dots and win when one side connects 5 dots. The fifth step would be to make a computer that can play against a player by following certain rules that are coded to the computer. I would have to acquire the skill on how to make a computer that would make a move depending on what the human player played. I would have to research on where to make the game and how to start to make a game.
